#  Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic
<br/><br/>

### Overview
This COVID-19 data analysis project aims to explore and analyze various aspects of the pandemic using available data sources, such as official reports, and datasets from the World Health Organization. The project typically involves several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and interpretation of findings.
<br/><br/>

### Data Collection
The first step involves gathering relevant data related to COVID-19, including information on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing, demographics, and geographical distribution. The data source was the World Health Organisation's official website(WHO) - https://www.who.int
<br/><br/>

### Tools
- Excel for data cleaning
- Azure Data Studio (SQL) for analysis
- Microsoft Power BI for data visualization
<br/><br/>

### Data Preprocessing & Transformations
Once the data is collected, preprocessing steps are performed to clean and prepare it for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and aggregating data at appropriate levels (e.g., daily, weekly, by country or region).
